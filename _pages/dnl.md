## First Excersise

> I am currently studying at NYUAD Film and New Media and Theatre. In my final Semester I embarked on a transformative journey by enrolling in an introductory course in digital humanities. I am here to  explore digital literacy, learn a new practical skill as I have not yet obtained any knwolwenge  within the field of coding and even borader terms within the field of digital humanities.

Before immersing myself in the world of digital humanities, we had developed our own strategies for navigating the digital landscape in both daily life and academics. As a Film and New Media  major, I am not particularly well-versed in coding languages such as Python and Java, using them for content creation, software development, and data manipulation. My academic journey was definitely not marked by problem-solving, algorithm design, and collaborative coding through platforms like GitHub. But I am excited to learn.

My first steps included getting to know the Github website and experiment with personalizing my pages thorugh using a cheatsheet the professor provided. Here is an example:

My peers from Interactive Media, Environmental Studies, Business and Marketing, Literature, and Creative Writing have their own digital toolkits and they are very kind to help me when I (often) need it. Interactive Media students excell in user-centered design that they do so fast and almost like second nature and interactive storytelling, often utilizing software like Adobe Creative Suite. Environmental Studies majors leverage data analysis software for environmental research, while Business and Marketing students hone their skills in data analytics platforms for market analysis. Students in Literature and Creative Writing dive deep into research databases to fuel their literary and artistic pursuits.

However, the digital humanities course has illuminated the intersection of our diverse disciplines in the digital age. Content creation, once thought to be confined to specific fields, took on a multidisciplinary dimension. We explored creating interactive websites, digital art installations, immersive narratives, and AI-generated content. Our collaborative efforts showcased the power of interdisciplinary collaboration, blurring the lines between art, science, and storytelling.

Social interaction and collaboration will be soon evolving. Platforms like Slack, Discord, and online forums became hubs for exchanging ideas, sparking discussions, and collaborating on projects. We found ourselves engaging in thought-provoking conversations that spanned our areas of expertise, enriching our perspectives and generating innovative ideas. 

Research data management and manipulation emerged as a common thread that united us all. We delved into text analysis, data visualization, and digital archives. Tools like Zotero and Omeka became invaluable for organizing, annotating, and sharing research materials. The importance of data literacy transcended individual majors, equipping us to navigate the data-driven landscape of the digital age.

Our critical reflection on our current abilities led us to appreciate the concept of “computational thinking” in the age of AI. We understood that skills in data analysis, algorithm understanding, and result interpretation were universally valuable, regardless of our major. As AI continues to shape our world, these skills will empower us to harness its potential for innovation and informed decision-making.

Digital humanities is broadening our horizons, offering fresh perspectives on our respective fields of study. We began to contemplate the ethical implications of AI and data usage within our disciplines. Computer Science majors questioned the ethical responsibilities of AI developers, while Literature and Creative Writing students considered the impact of AI-generated content on storytelling. Environmental Studies majors could potentially explore AI’s potential in climate change monitoring, and Business and Marketing students delved into AI-driven market analysis.

Looking ahead, we are excited to continue our exploration of new ways of thinking and working. We aim to cultivate a holistic approach to education that recognizes the value of interdisciplinary thinking in a digitally driven world. We envision a future where collaboration between artists, scientists, scholars, and creators becomes the norm, fostering innovation and pushing the boundaries of our fields.
### Conclusion {#custom-id}
In conclusion, my journey through digital humanities hopefully will be a transformative one. I would like to leanr basic vocabulary to computational language that is to me yet quite honestly is forgein. I would like to know how to make a website confidentaly, solely relaying on a coding language and have a more diverse understanign of the data is. I am also excited to find my confidence to get more creative with these new skills to and be able to use it in my artmaking process at some point.
