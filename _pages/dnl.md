## First Excersise

> I am currently studying at NYUAD Film and New Media and Theatre. In my final Semester, I decided to step out of my comfort zone and enroll in an introductory course called digital humanities which heavily targets a field of my insecurities: computer languages and computational techniques. I am now here to learn a new practical skill while delving into ethics and critical analysis of these processes. 

Although my academic journey thus far was definitely not marked by language around algorithm design, and collaborative coding through platforms like GitHub or SublimeText, I am challenged and excited to learn.

My first steps included getting to know the Github website and experiment with personalizing my pages thorugh using a cheatsheet the professor provided. Here is an example:

I have always found this particular field overwhelming and a definite source of my anxiety as dealing with technology became an inevitable dependency in my life without, as Berry/Fagerjord’ article “On The Way To Computational Thinking” points out, “a detailed and less mystified understanding” for the reamls of computers. Learning to program is invaluable empowering knowledge knowing the world that we now live in during such a highly computational age. Yet it can indeed cause anxiety to try to obtain and get to the bottom of the question of computer language and data for someone with such a limited understanding as me. Thus, I appreciated Yanni Alexander Loukissas’s reading on Local Origins talking about “big data” never actually being big but how it is more about our modern attitudes toward data than just its size. I related to how he notices the term evoking anxiety, particularly in contexts like surveillance and intelligence gathering. Despite the diverse interpretations of what "big" means, all digital data, regardless of scale, are ultimately made up of small signals. The ideology of big data extends beyond massive datasets, influencing even smaller-scale initiatives. It emphasizes collecting vast amounts of information while downplaying the importance of data origins and relying solely on data for understanding, sidelining other forms of knowledge.

Through thinking more about this reading in connection with what we have been discussing in class I started to gain an understanding of the importance of recognizing and valuing local knowledge in various contexts, including scientific and technological studies. The term "local" has been used to challenge the dichotomy between scientific knowledge and other forms of knowledge production thus by adopting a local perspective, scholars can gain deeper insights into the historical and cultural dimensions of knowledge systems, including those related to data. Understanding knowledge practices in their local contexts allows for a more comprehensive and perhaps accurate means of engaging with data settings instead
of simply data sets. I have not known how éocal methodologies involve establishing intimate connections not just with the data itself, but also with the specific circumstances under which the data is generated. Therefore it is important not only to analyze the representational and rhetorical aspects of data from a distant perspective, explore the values and assumptions embedded within it. Implicitly, it becomes relevant to think about the significance of adopting a local approach in data collection and analysis, strategies for fostering local audience interest in data, and the various models of local data practices.

Besides discussing local approaches we also folded into the discoveries of distant and close reading such as roaming The New Centre of Reacher and Practise’s course Feminism in the Canon of Philosophy: A Research Lab. This I found to be an interesting continuation of the conversation with Ama Bemma Adwetewa-Badu on distant reading. Distant reading, according to Ama, becomes a tool to think beyond the canon and more broadly about a larger corps of texts and therefore about issues of inclusion and standardization of human epistemology. As the research lab points out it is also about a lack of mutual recognition of expanding the canon to the margins leading to the alienation of feminist philosophy, women philosophers, and of course other historically degraded voices and opinions. I find it interesting how the course is structured starting with defining feminist philosophy, what it is, and what it stands for, and only after it moves towards discussing the “heritage” and what exactly feminist philosophy is excluded from. It brings up an interesting point about what we consider the basis of human epistemology and why we feel it necessary to tackle it as something linear, chronological, and thus hierarchical. To understand the present it is inherent to look into the past but what and where we start our research will manipulate the perspective through which we continue our journey. Starting with the “canon”, feminist philosophy cannot be more than something that is perhaps revolutionary or rather foreign in the light of the history of philosophical teaching. Yet reconstructing our ideas of the “canon”, having a more distant approach allows us to look at the pillars of human philosophy through the lens of our modern gaze and realize feminist philosophers are not just innovations of our modern times but something that has an ongoing presence even from times when it was undesired, unheard and most importantly undocumented. 

In the second half of the semester, we transitioned into different forms of digital mapping and image analysis.
Reading Krupar’s “Map Power and Map Methodologies for Social Justice”, I wanted to highlight the transformative potential of grassroots mapping projects in addressing social justice issues. Instead of relying on traditional mapping methods controlled by governments or corporations, grassroots mapping empowers local communities to illustrate and thus represent their own spaces, experiences, and struggles shifting the focus from maps as tools of control to vehicles for grassroots activism. By engaging in DIY cartography, individuals mobilize local knowledge and experiences, fostering a more radical politics of place. This approach not only avoids commercial exploitation but also inspires collective action aimed at challenging dominant power structures and advocating for a more equitable society.
In a way thinking about communities, and demographic shifts through mapping during these classes led us to our Unproject With Joanna that we decided to map the temporality of the UAE’s landscape and through that investigate structures of Memory in the UAE. 
Using AI to help us organize, interpret and orientate some the provided data has been a great experiment I have used AI for two of my three assignments to interpret or generate data. It has been challenging from time to time as it misinterprets a lot of my instructions or gives faulty information yet it has been a great challenge to adjust to a language that gives sufficient and precise information to ChatGPT and maximizes efficiency in its response.  For example in assignment 3, asking the ChatGPT to analyze the data and organize it in different columns,  it was helpful to give it an example, to teach it the correct language so that it recognizes and builds upon that pattern.
In conversation with working with AI, we transitioned to looking at images and interpreting them with digital tools. 
I found Drimmer’s article How AI is Hijacking Art History”
Quite interesting in this regard. 
He expresses concern about the media's coverage of AI-assisted revelations in the art world. While these projects generate feel-good stories about AI, they do not actually reveal secrets or solve mysteries. Using examples like the Modigliani and Picasso paintings, the author argues that these projects lack artistic or historical value, as they merely recreate existing X-ray images using neural style transfer. Moreover, the attention given to such projects reflects a broader trend of privileging scientific approaches over humanistic ones, leading to the marginalization of the humanities. I think we should adopt a more skeptical approach to these developments and question whether they truly benefit anyone beyond AI enthusiasts and profit-driven interests.


Looking ahead, I  am excited to continue our exploration of new ways of thinking and working critically and practically about computer languages in the realm of digital humanities. I hope we will continue to aim to cultivate a holistic approach to education that recognizes the value of interdisciplinary thinking in a digitally driven world.

### Conclusion {#custom-id}
In conclusion, in my journey through digital humanities, I would like to learn basic vocabulary to computational language that is to me yet quite honestly foreign. I would like to know how to make a website confidently, solely relying on a coding language, and have a just a little bit more detailed understanding of computational language. I am also excited to find the confidence to get more creative with these new skills and be able to use them in my artmaking process at some point.
