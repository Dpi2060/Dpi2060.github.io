# Abstract: 

What kinds of memories, ghosts, or ruins does each place hold? One of the most popular pre-modern Arabic poetic traditions starts every poem with a person standing before the ruins of a house they used to share with loved ones, reminiscing or lamenting what once was, for better or for worse, before them. This is the idea that inspired our line of questioning that we are hoping to answer through Digital Humanities tools. Starting with a foundation of digital mapping, our starting habitus is the UAE, a shape shifting land that we can see give and take form before our eyes. Thinking a little bit along the lines of the likes of the Wayback Machine, we want to compile snapshots of a range of locations, visualizing them both in physical and mental manifestations. Bringing together verbal accounts of personal experiences and memories of a space, as well as an array of visual and historical data to unearth the different faces that a place has had over the years. The final product, would ideally be an interactive map of the UAE containing all the places we can gather enough data for, before we depart for other loci around the world to apply our model to their unique environmental conditions.

## Introduction


What is the project’s main focus, and what specific aspects does it explore?
What are the project’s main objectives or goals? What do you hope to do with the data? Do you have any hypotheses about how they will be “useful”?
What kinds of values or ethics guide your project?

In this project, we aim to explore the abrupt temporality of the UAE’s landscape and scrutinize how memories are structured in relation to these provisional spaces. This project seeks to examine how UAE communities cultivate their sense of belonging; an intimate definition of home amidst their rapidly evolving environment. Our goal is to delve into the intricacies of dwelling and demographic dynamics by reimagining the altering landscapes through a series of bdeeply personal recollections.
The UAE is among the few nations to experience fast, pervasive economic growth and social change. After its establishment in 1971, and the formation period the country saw the structure and construction of the nation in major physical shifts. Over time, cities, buildings, and infrastructure rose from the formerly deserted areas and small settlements. Within such a swiftly changing landscape in the UAE, the nation's vernacular architecture is rapidly and continuously being replaced by contemporary structures. Buildings tended to last for a few decades before being demolished and replaced by modern ‘iconic’ structures. Through the architectural elevation, the previous landscape and structures remain mainly a memory within the minds of its community. Yet through such erasure, the question remains: 
How do we navigate the absence of these spaces?  What do these places hold and where do they go within us?  And how do we use technology to reimagine these places? We would like to create an interactive map to investigate how we preserve, and structure memory in landscapes, specifically in the recent history of the UAE.
 The interactive map would be the reinterpretation of spaces that cannot be found in their physical shape but remain as idiosyncratic descriptions of the community.  We would like to treat this map as a collection of oral archives; a mapping of the autographical narrative around UAE and investigate how the local community shapes the value of these landscapes and structures of the nation. 
We envision creating an agglomeration of various map pins based on labeling some of the spaces that remain in the community’s imagination.  We would like to work with an interview-based approach, conducted across a broad spectrum of residents to encompass the many experiences of expatriate workers as well as the local’s dwelling history. Through this research, we will prompt them to commemorate landscapes, buildings, and spaces that are no longer part of the UAE’s scenery by sharing a fond memory; a personal description of scapes. As such, we aim to investigate how these landscapes can be reimagined, verbally portrayed, and captured perpetually.
We envision a future for this project that expands into representing a broader scope of experiences and eventually moving beyond the UAE periphery as an applied method in commemorating the temporary landscapes all around the world.
