>A Voyant Tool analysis on Beckett's repetation


# Introduction
In this exercise, I was curious to explore Samuel Beckett’s realms of literacy and theatricality and the ways in which he embodies the outburst of emotions by harnessing the machinery of repetition. Roaming around different features of Voyant Tool I created a corpus of three of his texts, *Not I*, *That Time*, and the AI generation version of his 1963 manuscript of *Kilcool*, an early iteration of what later became *Not I* (1972) and arguably *That Time* (1976). As Katherine Weiss in “Bits and Pieces: The Fragmented Body in Samuel Beckett’s Not I and That Time” talks of these two pieces as “Beckett’s sibling plays” (187) and David Clare in her text: ”Turns Wick Low’: Samuel Beckett’s Darkening Vision and an Irish County” identifies Kilcool as early version of the mentioned sibling plays, I became interested in seeing the literacy evolution and analogy of these texts. Thus, my intention in merging these texts into the conversation aims for an investigation of their literary kinship: how one text possibly emerged into the other in the creative process how and to what extent these short plays of Beckett are related. Thematically they are all very similar to each other in grappling with Beckett’s eternal philosophical scrutiny of the agony of birth instilled as primal anxiety in human beings, so I was interested in the language and structure Becket so concisely constructed. Although for this exercise I use the original version of *Not I* and  *That time* taken from Collected Shorter Plays, I decided to generate Kilcool by AI using **ChatGPT** due to my inability to find a published original version of the *Kilcool* manuscript itself.

# Building the Corpus
I personally found the process of bringing these texts together and analyzing them as a corpus super productive. According to  Ama Bemma Adwetewa-Badu's discussion on” Distant Reading: ”Reading is good but it is not a working solution”. Creating a corpus and employing the techniques of distant reading can be a more effective way of reading more holistically. Yet as much as these digital tools can get into the macrostructure of a single text, I found that this process also gave me access to more text at a time than an attentive linear read. By bringing together a larger number of texts, I was able to not only look at each text in depth but also see them in relation to each other: see how texts function contextually. As the podcast rightly suggests, A big output of data cannot mean anything prolific necessarily until it is understood through its context. Similarly, Ama Bemma points out that distant reading is a tool, a process that goes hand in hand with close reading. One cannot do distant reading without also looking at the text attentively. This is why it was important for me to first investigate Beckett’s pieces in the context of his history of writing to then later analyze the data provided by the Voyant tool. I chose Beckett’s work for this exercise with a specific interest in how he handles language: his brevity is merely an expression of Beckett’s determination to pare his writing to essentials, to waste no words on trivia. Despite Beckett's acknowledgment of language's inherent limitations in conveying meaning, paradoxically, it remains one of the most potent tools for expressing his worldview. With this particular attention to how he creates language illuminating the modern sense of disorientation, I was interested in how AI could imitate such an abstract form of language that, for Beckett, so consciously revolves around the philosophy of humanity: of who are we; what is the true nature of our self?  What does it really mean when a human says “I”? As the prompt to **Chatgpt**, I gave David Clare’s description of Kilcool: ”The first draft ends poignantly, as the woman remembers her fateful train journey out to live with her aunt. She says that, at the time, the world seemed full of possibility. She remembers gazing out of the train at the beautiful Irish Sea, passing the picturesque Dun Laoghaire pier, and going through the tunnel at Bray Head. She recalls that, at the end of her journey, she met her aunt who took her by the hand and reassured her that they would be happy living together. This is heartbreaking since we know that the orphaned woman is now dying alone and is praying for God, the giver of light, to take away the light and these torturing memories.” (7) In addition to that, I also introduced *Not I* and *That Time* to **Chatgpt** as a source of imitation, building blocks in generating its own version of Kilcool. To accentuate his unique application of repetition which will be discussed in this exploration through Voyant Tools, I would like to point out how Beckett employs monologue as a form, I think, to illustrate the itrapersonal interaction being driven by egocentricity and a disregard for alternative perspectives. Consequently, these pieces all build on repeating questions and ideas multiple times before receiving irrelevant answers. I find it interesting how even the **Chatgpt**-created piece followed such construction of a monologue even tho the prompt did not specifically give such instructions or creative limitations.

# Word clouds
Roaming the word clouds generated for each piece, I found it interesting how in both *Not I* and *That Time* the most frequent words seemed to be something that did not necessarily say anything about each text formally or thematically. In That Time it is the title word and in *Not I* it is the word “buzzing” that is most common which becomes a tool of constant interruption in the manifested stream of consciousness as the mouth speaks compulsively. With the generated text, however, words like “darkness” (shadows), “movement”, and “pause” come up almost like a description of what is happening in the two original texts provided as prompts. In this sense, I found it interesting how **Chatgpt**created a version that becomes a commentary, a reflection of how the inspirational pieces feel, look, and function.

Also, “time”, “pause”, “stop”, and “old”…these words come up repeatedly in all three texts which I found interesting in the context of Beckett who seems to treat time as a “metaphysical problem”( Seamus 64). For him, time becomes a weightless image, as Seamus Deane in “Joyce and Beckett” pointed out, a “dimension in which thought moves just as space is the dimension in which the body moves.” 

# Bubble feature
Before looking at the text methodically, I did not realize how heavily Beckett is using reparation to create his image of time. Yet using the ‘bubbles’ function visualizes the high-frequency terms read in document order, I had a chance to understand this notion of repetition as I saw the bubble of each word grow and grow as we move in the text. Such as the word “time” in that time is repeated 53 times in this single monologue. This visual representation helped me understand how the repetitive quality, with words, phrases, and sentences is a technique that not only highlights the monotonous repetitiveness of human actions but also disrupts the linear progression of events, suggesting that everything concludes as it commences: humanity is perpetually in the process of becoming.

# Link Tool
I found it also interesting, however, to look at the ‘link’ tool which helped me see how these reparation syntaxes sometimes alter and change as some of the repeated words became linked to different words each time..such as the syntax “dull roar like falls and the beam” is sometimes “ferreting”, sometimes “poking”, “flickering on an off” and so on. The text is long, tense, and fast when performed and sometimes these slight differences in the repetition are not even obvious to the eyes and ears of the audience. Yet this might also be to point out Beckett’s conscious philosophical question about the self. According to Connor in “Samuel Beckett: Repetition, Theory, and Text”, “the self is brought into being by its existence in time” (52), and thus it is inherently inclined to change in time: “so that trying to decide which comes ‘first’, the self or time, is a vain exercise. But if time is what constitutes identity, it is also time that unsettles or ‘deforms’ it” (Connor 52).

# Conclusion
Overall, looking into these different tools, I found it fascinating to be able to discover more and more about the philosophy of Beckett and how repetition is so strictly tight to his interpretation of identity through visualizing information simply derived from the corpus. As I was wandering through the different tools, it was interesting to see how each tool took different shapes in illustrating the same data essentially. It also led me to the conclusion that only a few became appropriate to demonstrate some of my specific insights and some I found less constrictive. As Johanna Drucker in the *Digital Humanities Coursbook* points out, “no data has an inherent visual form” (99). Such as the stream graphs I found less effective or appropriate in communicating any of my arguments in analyzing my corpus due to its unclear design of the x-axis which divided the text into specific sections yet the motivation for such division remained unclear to me.  Through this process, I found that some of these features could have given information that might not be accurate to base conclusions on. Johanna Drucker thus rightly calls our attention to common errors in interpreting information visualizations and how all visualizations can only ever be “interpretations, or presentations of fact” approached with skepticism to avoid contributing “to the reification of misinformation”. Through this exercise, I became more alert about understanding the language of graphics and its artistry in combining “conceptual insight with design acuity”. Still, I am not sure that my selected tools in this exercise were the most appropriate to compare my selected corpus and communicate my arguments around the use of repetition in Beckett’s language yet I would like to accentuate based on Druker points that my analysis is solely the product of my loose interpretation and assumptions and by no means are statements or actualization of Beckett’s actual thoughts and intentions.
